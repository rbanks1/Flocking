# Flocking

This is a P5.JS project that uses code derived originally from Daniel Shiffman to create entities that flock together. Daniel's version was originally written for Processing, so I've adjusted it to run with P5. See Daniel's code here:
https://processing.org/examples/flocking.html

I've also added some code to create "pillars" which act to repel the flocking "boids". You can lay down these pillars to create fences and barriers to drive the boids in particular directions.
